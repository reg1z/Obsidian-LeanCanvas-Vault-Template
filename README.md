## Instructions

You can either:
- Download `LeanCanvas-Template.zip`, extract the files, and open the folder as a vault in Obsidian; OR
- Clone this repo and open the `LeanCanvas-Template` as a vault in Obsidian

The individual `.md` files make up `LC0_FullCanvas.canvas`, the main "dashboard" view of the plan. `.canvas` files require Obsidian to view properly.
